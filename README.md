# Overview

This lab will involve working with digital archive and exhibit platforms and tools to think about avenues for presenting or sharing historical work. Specifically, it focuses on workflows for building out item-level metadata needed to generate a robust digital archive/exhibit and prototyping options for sharing or presenting that work using digital exhibits and interactive digital storytelling tools. 

This lab provides a few different types of open-ended opportunities for thinking about how to share/communicate/present information related to primary source materials, in a smaller-scale, lower-stakes setting than the final project. I encourage folks to approach this lab as a pilot or “proof of concept” for work they might want to continue or develop further in the final project.

# How to Work Through This Lab

[Link to Google Drive workspace for this lab](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13uxuOwLOO6taBSmj-8OvDnWf7EcKQZu3?usp=sharing)

This lab is organized into three main sections:
- What's possible under the umbrella of digital archives, digital exhibits, and immersive/interactive digital storytelling
- What's involved in building these kinds of projects or components
- What might be possible with these tools/approaches and primary sources or archival material related to ND football

So the lab starts by looking at existing digital projects that incorporate these tools/methods, to think about what might be possible related to the work of this class.

Then, folks will have a chance to work behind-the-scenes with building these types of projects.

In that behind the scenes work, we'll be thinking about...
- The technical infrastructure needed to publish these projects
- The metadata that drives these projects
- What types of contextual or narrative information is also part of these projects

Lastly, folks will have a chance to take up these methods to source material of your choosing that relates to ND football.

As we think about how you could take up or extend these methods, we'll be doing that with an eye toward the final project.

## Lab Timeline

We'll spend two Thursday class periods working on this lab: 10/28 and 11/4.
- Goal for the end of 10/28 is to have identified a set of materials you want to work with, have started building out metadata, and have figured out the needed technical infrastructure for the digital archive/exhibit components of the lab
- Goal for the end of 11/4 is to have started piecing things together for the digital archive/exhibit components of the lab and decided on next steps for the immersive/interactive digital story component of the lab

Ideally we're finishing up this lab during Week #12 (week of 11/8) so we can turn and start to focus on the final project. 

## Lab Notebook Components

- Reflections/observations from the Background section of the lab
- Reflections/observations from the Metadata section of the lab
- Reflections/observations from your work exploring tools and sample projects
- Your group's work building out digital exhibit/archive and immersive/interactive digital story
  * Any data files you worked with
  * Public-facing things you created (GitHub Pages site, Omeka collection/exhibit, StoryMap, timeline, etc)
- Individual reflection
  * At least 200 words (or 2-3 minutes audio/video), addressing the following questions:
    * What you learned about metadata through this lab
    * What you learned about digital exhibits/archives through this lab
    * What you learned about immersive/interactive digital storytelling through this lab
    * How you're thinking about these tools/approaches as they relate to ND football history and primary sources differently after this lab
    * Where you would go next with these tools/methods (other research questions/topics you're interested in exploring, other data sources or types of data you would want to be able to work with, etc)
    * Other comments/questions/observations

If you're working in Google Drive, you can just submit a link to Google Drive.

Notebooks can be individual or collaborative.

Could be a text analysis extension/continuation from lab #1

Could be taking tools/methods covered in lab #2 and applying/connecting them to new or additional datasets
