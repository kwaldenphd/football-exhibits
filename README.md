# Overview

[Link to Google Drive workspace for this lab](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/17-dYlpkFt2wOLNzvUS22mx3dU3ZxtIW7?usp=sharing)

This lab involves thinking about how to move from item-level metadata to different modes of curating, connecting, and contextualizing primary source material using digital tools and platforms. 

We'll start by thinking about how we add to item-level metadata to more fully contextualize a particular primary source, with an eye toward being able to make connections with other sources (or types of source material).

Then we'll think about different tools or methods that let us connect this contextual information to primary sources, and connect primary sources with each other, in the service of a larger historical narrative or argument.

In addition to the different platforms we'll explore in this lab, our work will be the foundation for a [public digital exhibit through the Hesburgh Libraries](https://digital-exhibits.library.nd.edu/). 

## Exploring other projects 

Explore...
- [One of the Colored Conventions Projects exhibits](https://coloredconventions.org/exhibits/) (many to choose from!)
- [One of the place-based walking tour projects](https://curatescape.org/projects/)
- [One of the interactive digital stories built using ArcGIS StoryMaps](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-storymaps/albums/digital-humanities)

As you explore, consider…
- What types of sources it uses, and how it uses those sources (interactive maps/visualizations, text, immersive media, etc)
- Choices the authors/creators made around design and presentation, and how that shapes the user experience 
  * To put that another way, what are some of your takeaways from engaging with the project? What aspects of the project stand out to you (and how/why)?
- Ideas that spark for how aspects of what this project is doing could be useful for telling a story about ND football
  * Or, aspects of the project design/composition that might connect to some of the primary source materials we’ve been exploring 

## Background

We'll be anchoring our work in this lab around a set of primary sources- specifically the Notre Dame Football game programs whose reproductions hang in the renovated stadium concourse. 

<p align="center"><img src="https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/edf2e00/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4916x3461+0+0/resize/880x620!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Flegacy%2Fsites%2Fwvpe%2Ffiles%2F201708%2Fconcourse.jpg"></p>

The 2017 renovation project that led to the selection of these game programs for the concourse was part of the multi-million dollar "Campus Crossroads" project.

We'll have a chance to see these game program reproductions in-person in a few weeks when we visit the stadium.

## Metadata

This collection of game programs (72 total) span 1913 to 1969.
- [Link to game program metadata](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fxH_fkXg5P2CFWSkoJ-pCM5n20mwuObXwErK9ZUtGUo/edit#gid=298564474)
- [Link to stadium concourse diagram](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11aCaWfr1dNcPQkMadq9hvdqYlcyZNRDH/view?usp=drive_link)

The [Google Sheets workbook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fxH_fkXg5P2CFWSkoJ-pCM5n20mwuObXwErK9ZUtGUo/edit#gid=1867259709) has a few different tabs:
- `concourse-programs` includes information on where the programs are located in the stadium concourse, as well as basic game metadata (date, opponent, location, score)
- `game-annotations` is where we'll start to flesh out details and other context information for each program
- `season-annotations` is where we'll start to flesh out details and other context information for each season
- `era-annotations` is where (if needed) we'll start to flesh out details and other context information for the eras represented by the stadium concourse programs
- `other-sources` is where folks can include linsk to non-University Archives material

We have a corresponding Google Drive infrastructure, in the [`concourse-programs`](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-pKjILRWe-HP8FdVvsiUHpq-dFPZDt0G?usp=drive_link) folder which groups programs by season, and includes placeholder folders for other sources we may find and want to connect to the game programs.

# Part I: Annotations 

Before we start thinking about how we connect different sources (or bodies of source material), we need additional background and context on the game programs.

## Step #1: Identify 3-4 game programs you want to write annotations for. Add your name to the `Assignment` tab in the [`season-annotations` sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fxH_fkXg5P2CFWSkoJ-pCM5n20mwuObXwErK9ZUtGUo/edit#gid=298564474).

Once folks have claimed game programs, we'll form 4 groups loosely organized by date (and head coach era):
- Group #1: 1913-1930 (Jesse Harper, Knute Rockne)
- Group #2: 1931-1943 (Frank Leahy, part i)
- Group #3: 1944-1953 (Frank Leahy, part ii)
- Group #4: 1954-1971 (Ara Parseghian)

Folks can work primarily individually on the individual game program annotations, but leverage the group to write brief overview or recaps of each season and era.
- Add group member names to the `Assignment` columns in the `season-annotations` and `era-annotations` sheets once you're in a group.
- Feel free to divide and conquer individual seasons within the group.

## Step #2: Start preliminary research, using key University Archives collections as a starting point:

For the game programs that have been digitized, a good first step is to dig into the game program itself.

Then fold in other University Archives sources
- [Digest of University Archives digital collections](https://github.com/kwaldenphd/football-exhibits/blob/main/archive-resources.md) 
  * [Scholastic student magazine, 1867-2011](https://archives.nd.edu/Scholastic/)
  * [Scholastic football season reviews, 1901-2010](https://archives.nd.edu/Football/)
  * [Observer student newspaper, 1966-present](https://archives.nd.edu/Observer/)

Folks could do much deeper dives on particular games, seasons, or eras. For now, try to ground your annotations in at least one primary source (beyond the game program itself).
- Add a PDF or image file of the source(s) you're using to the relevant subfolder in the [`concourse-programs` Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-pKjILRWe-HP8FdVvsiUHpq-dFPZDt0G).
- Don't be afraid to use screenshots or images from larger documents if there's something specific you want to highlight.

Other encyclopedic resources (Wikipedia, College Football Reference, etc) are fair game- just make sure you cite appropriately (and note other sources you're using in the `other-sources` [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fxH_fkXg5P2CFWSkoJ-pCM5n20mwuObXwErK9ZUtGUo/edit#gid=1385143351) tab).

## Step #3: Write the game annotations.

In the context of individual games, your annotation can cover....
- When and where the game took place.
- Result of the game (and mention of any events of note around the game)
- Brief description of what's on the program cover

An [example annotation that includes some of these components](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/footballcovers/items/footballcovers90.html), courtesy of the University of Idaho Libraries.
- If you want to explore further, head to the [Hesburgh Libraries' Digital Exhibits website](https://digital-exhibits.library.nd.edu/) for various examples of annotations that in many cases go beyond the scope of what you're asked to develop for this lab.

Annotations can go in the `Annotation` column in the `game-annotations` sheet. If you're struggling to make your annotation work in the spreadsheet format, we'll figure out another workflow.

We can also add tags as part of our annotation. These would be things like team or school names, coach or player names, or other significant entitites. Tags should be separated by a semi-colon (`;`) and can go in the `Tags` column.

## Step #4: Write the season or era annotations.

Once group members have developed annotations for their individual game programs, work as a group to write a brief season overview. 
- Season annotations go in the `Annotation` column of the `season-annotations` sheet.

In the context of this lab, a season annotation can be a few sentences/paragraph that mentions...
- Head coach, stand-out players (or other members of the coaching staff)
- The season result (win-loss record, and any bowl games or playoff appearances)
- Notable games (or other events of note)

Then, work as a group to write a brief era overview.
- Era annotations go in the `Annotation` column of the `era-annotations` sheet.

An era annotation can cover similar ground- a few sentences/paragraph that mentions...
- How the head coach arrived at Notre Dame (prior work / background)
- The coach's record (wins/losses, other notable achievements)
- Notable seasons or events
- Coach's legacy (statue, building, etc)

## Step #5: Reflection & Possible Next Steps

Spend some time as a group (and/or on your own) discussing and reflecting on....

- What you were able to synthesize or communicate via the different types of annotations
  * Types of sources or information that were helpful
  * Things your annotations are communicating about these games, seasons & eras
- Thoughts on organizing these game programs by season or era
  * Things that worked about this approach
  * Alternate approaches the group might want to explore

- Other things folks in the group want to explore in relation to these game programs. This could look like...
  * Deeper dives into the sources you identified
  * Other types of source material you want to explore
  * Other formats or ways of engaging with these sources

- Any preliminary thoughts on how you might want to connect or contextualize these programs and your annotation work via some type of public digital platform (thinking about the sample projects we explored at the start of this lab and earlier in the semester) 

# Part II: Workflows

Now that we have a solid foundation of metadata and annotations for the game programs, let's jump into a couple different digital workflows that let us connect and organize our work.

## Timeline

Developed by Northwestern University's [Knight Lab](https://knightlab.northwestern.edu/) (collaboration between the journalism and engineering schools), "TimelineJS is an open-source tool that enables anyone to build visually rich, interactive timelines. Beginners can create a timeline using nothing more than a Google spreadsheet."
- [Learn more about TimelineJS and explore sample projects](https://timeline.knightlab.com/)

We have a `timelineJS-template` tab on our [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fxH_fkXg5P2CFWSkoJ-pCM5n20mwuObXwErK9ZUtGUo/edit#gid=1867259709), which has already been populated with dates, titles, and image links (and published as a timeline).
- [Link to our timeline](https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1fxH_fkXg5P2CFWSkoJ-pCM5n20mwuObXwErK9ZUtGUo&font=Default&lang=en&initial_zoom=2&height=650)

```html
<!-- embed code for our timeline -->
<iframe src='https://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1fxH_fkXg5P2CFWSkoJ-pCM5n20mwuObXwErK9ZUtGUo&font=Default&lang=en&initial_zoom=2&height=650' width='100%' height='650' webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen frameborder='0'></iframe>
```

But, we need to add in our game annotations. Paste your game annotations in the `Text` column. If you want to add a caption to the game program cover, that can go in the `Media Caption` column.

Once you've added annotations, you can refresh the Google Sheet to see the updated timeline.

### Timeline Discussion/Reflection Questions

Spend some time as a group (and/or on your own) discussing and reflecting on....

- What the timeline format facilitates in terms of connecting and contextualizing information about the game programs
  * Things the timeline emphasizes about these games, seasons & eras

- Affordances or drawbacks of the platform; Thoughts on organizing these game programs chronologically
  * Things that worked about this approach
  * Alternate approaches the group might want to explore

- Other things folks in the group want to explore in relation to these game programs (or digital formats for contextualizing and connecting them). 

## StoryMap

We encountered ArcGIS Online [in a previous lab](https://github.com/kwaldenphd/football-structured-data/blob/main/mapping.md#arcgis-online), where we explored making interactive digital maps using ArcGIS Online.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/football-exhibits/blob/main/images/figures/fig1.png?raw=true" width=60%></p>

Now, we'll have a chance to think about how those maps can be part of immersive, media-rich experiences through [ArcGIS StoryMaps](https://storymaps.arcgis.com), "a story authoring web-based application that allows you to share your maps in the context of narrative text and other multimedia content."

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/football-exhibits/blob/main/images/figures/fig2.png?raw=true" width=25%></p>

First, head to https://storymaps.arcgis.com and click the `Sign in to ArcGIS StoryMaps` button.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/football-exhibits/blob/main/images/figures/fig3.png?raw=true" width=25%></p>

Use the organizational URL option and sign in using the credentials you used in the last lab.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/football-exhibits/blob/main/images/figures/fig4.png?raw=true" width=65%></p>

Under the `Group` option (under `Stories`), folks should see a class group pre-populated with a  `Notre Dame Stadium Concourse` project.
- Link to our group: https://arcg.is/1C1Xry2
- Link to the project: https://arcg.is/0iCDzG
- Link to the underlying map: https://arcg.is/9KzD0

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/football-exhibits/blob/main/images/figures/fig5.png?raw=true" width=65%></p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/football-exhibits/blob/main/images/figures/fig6.png?raw=true" width=65%></p>

Click on the story- Prof. Walden has added some preliminary content, including map pins for the stadium concourse programs. 

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/football-exhibits/blob/main/images/figures/fig7.png?raw=true" width=40%></p>

But, if you click on a specific game program, you'll see there is no content beyond the cover and title. This is where we'll add in our game annotations!

NOTE- ArcGIS StoryMaps has some limits on real-time collaboration! From [their documentation](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-storymaps/author-and-share/co-author-a-story.htm):

<blockquote>" If you edit an item at the same time as another coauthor, a notification will appear and display their name. You can click <bold>Exit</bold> to avoid losing any work, or you can select <bold>Overwrite</bold> to continue editing, which may result in some of the other coauthor's changes being lost. It is recommended that coauthors coordinate when collaborating on a story, collection, or a theme.</blockquote>

### Option #1: If there's anyone in the group with prior experience using ArcGIS StoryMaps, let's have those folks take the lead on pasting in our annotations.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/football-exhibits/blob/main/images/figures/fig8.png?raw=true" width=30%></p>

- Click `Edit Story` in the top right-hand corner to edit the story

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/football-exhibits/blob/main/images/figures/fig9.png?raw=true" width=30%></p>

- Paste in the annotations for each game program. If needed, you can select text to open up additional formatting options.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/football-exhibits/blob/main/images/figures/fig10.png?raw=true" width=30%></p>

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/football-exhibits/blob/main/images/figures/fig11.png?raw=true" width=30%></p>

- Click `Publish` in the top right-hand corner to publish your updates.

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/kwaldenphd/football-exhibits/blob/main/images/figures/fig12.png?raw=true" width=65%></p>

### Option #2: While that's happening, others new to the platform can work through the "[Getting started with ArcGIS StoryMaps](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/cea22a609a1d4cccb8d54c650b595bc4)" tutorial to get a feel for the platform.
- [Link to tutorial](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/cea22a609a1d4cccb8d54c650b595bc4)

### StoryMap Discussion/Reflection Questions

Spend some time as a group (and/or on your own) discussing and reflecting on....

- What the StoryMap format facilitates in terms of connecting and contextualizing information about the game programs
  * Things the template Prof. Walden set up emphasizes about these games, seasons & eras
  * Other things that might be possible in the platform

- Affordances or drawbacks of the platform; Thoughts on organizing these game programs according to the stadium concourse layout
  * Things that worked about this approach
  * Alternate approaches the group might want to explore

- Other things folks in the group want to explore in relation to these game programs (or digital formats for contextualizing and connecting them). 
  * Any particular notes or comments on this platform

## Archive / Exhibit

Depending on what digital projects folks explored at the start of the this lab, you may have already encountered digital exhibits or archives in action. The [Colored Conventions Project's Digital Records website](https://omeka.coloredconventions.org/) is an example of a digital archive. 

We'll be working with a digital archive platform called `Collection Builder`, first developed by the [University Idaho Libraries](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/about.html).
- [Link to our CollectionBuilder site](https://kwaldenphd.github.io/nd-stadium-concourse/)
- [Link to the back-end GitHub repository](https://github.com/kwaldenphd/nd-stadium-concourse)

<blockquote>"CollectionBuilder is a set of flexible, static web templates for creating digital collection websites. These templates are driven by metadata and powered by modern static web technology. Using three primary components—a spreadsheet of metadata, a directory of assets, and a configuration file—CollectionBuilder helps users to build and customize sustainable, digital collections and exhibits for free, learning valuable development practices in the process."</blockquote>

Metadata is at the core of how a digital archive organizes and provides access to primary source material. Our [`collection-builder-metadata`](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fxH_fkXg5P2CFWSkoJ-pCM5n20mwuObXwErK9ZUtGUo/edit#gid=1291787307) Google Sheet already has game program metadata formatted for the platform we'll be exploring.

But, we need to add in our game annotations and the tags we built out for each game. Paste your game annotations in the `Description` column. Tags can go in the `subject` column.
- Prof. Walden (or future Dr. Swisher) will update the site's metadata so the site will reflect these changes!

### Exhibit Discussion/Reflection Questions

Spend some time as a group (and/or on your own) discussing and reflecting on....

- What the digital archive and exhibit format facilitates in terms of connecting and contextualizing information about the game programs
  * Things the template Prof. Walden set up emphasizes about these games, seasons & eras
  * Other things that might be possible in the platform

- Affordances or drawbacks of the platform; Thoughts on the various ways the platform organizes the game programs
  * Things that worked about this approach
  * Alternate approaches the group might want to explore

- Other things folks in the group want to explore in relation to these game programs (or digital formats for contextualizing and connecting them). 
  * Any particular notes or comments on this platform

# Part III: Horizons

Now that we've seen a few different examples, let’s start to think about how we might connect or organize a body of primary sources in some kind of digital space.

Folks are welcome to work on this in groups if there's an idea the group is organizing around. But folks are also welcome to move between collaborative and individual work here.

### Step #1: Reflection

First, spend some time in your group (and on your own), reflecting on...

- What you/your group were able to accomplish in this lab
  * What you like about what you did, or things you're noticing across this lab in terms of ways of contextualizing and connecting historical information
  * Ways in which the digital platform or format shaped the choices you made or how information was presented

- Things you're interested in exploring further. This could look like...
  * Deeper dives into the sources you identified
  * Other types of source material you want to explore
  * Other formats or ways of engaging with these sources

The workflows this lab introduced focused on the digital archive and digital exhibit dimensions of presenting or synthesizing historical information via digital tools and platforms. We focused on immersive or interactive digital stories that are either driven by metadata and/or operate as a media-rich long-form narrative.

But digital storytelling is a VERY BROAD term that can include everything from podcasts to video essays. Earlier in the semester, we've seen examples of other kinds of digital storytelling or treatment of sources....
- [ND Stories, How ND became the Fighting Irish](https://www.nd.edu/stories/whats-in-a-name/) (media-rich narrative)
  * [Audio version](https://news.nd.edu/news/how-notre-dame-became-the-fighting-irish/)

And there are MANY other types of work that fall under the umbrella of digital storytelling:

**Immersive long-form narrative**
- Platform: Adobe Express
- [Example](https://express.adobe.com/page/OVvbwUF0Qo1Cs/), [Tutorial](https://remix.nd.edu/photo-essay.html)

**Interactive Data Visualization**
- Platform (with example + tutorial): [StorylineJS](http://storyline.knightlab.com/) (Northwestern's Knight Lab)
- You could also generate annotated interactive visualizations programmatically using Plotly in Python or RStudio.
  * [Python](https://plotly.com/python/text-and-annotations/)
  * [RStudio](https://plotly.com/ggplot2/text-and-annotations/)

**360 Photo/Video**

There's also a whole world of 360 photo/video and virtual reality adjacent work that might fall under the digital storytelling umbrella.

A few user-friendly tools that support 360 photo/video:
- [SceneVR](https://scene.knightlab.com/) (Northwestern's Knight Lab)
- [ThingLink](https://www.thinglink.com/blog/how-to-make-a-360-virtual-tour/)
- [Google Cardboard Camera app](https://blog.google/products/google-ar-vr/cardboard-camera-ios/)

There's also a whole other world of more advanced tech applications in the area of [VR/MR/AR/XR](https://medium.com/@effinmickey/vr-ar-mr-xr-and-360-everything-youve-always-wanted-to-know-ae33e4515493) and [photogrammetry](https://rd.nytimes.com/projects/an-end-to-end-guide-to-photogrammetry-with-mobile-devices).

For these options, some of the things that you might need to build out along the way could include...
- Object inventory and/or metadata
- Design/visual content
- Text

## Step #2: Brainstorming

In previous labs, we used this "Now it's your turn" section at the end of the lab to develop a small-scale research proposal connected to the tools and methods covered in the lab. That's one way to approach the last section of this lab. But we can also use this time and space to start thinking more expansively about what folks might be interested in pursuing or building via the final project.
- [Link to the section of the syllabus that talks more about the final project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aYKyLlMB_O9uARg9NXDF32RU5DWbA1oj2b3pbciMA4U/edit#heading=h.3bze9rog87lt)

There's no requirement that you build a digital exhibit/archive/story for the final project. But if this lab has piqued your interest, I'd encourage folks to start to get thoughts on paper for the final project.

Otherwise, this is your turn to come up with a small-scale theme or topic related to the period of ND football history we've been looking at (or some of the broader themes we've been talking about) that you could explore using some of the tools and methods covered in this lab.

Folks are welcome to work on this in groups if there's an idea the group is organizing around. But folks are also welcome to move between collaborative and individual work here.

Some prompts that can structure your brainstorming...
- What kinds of sources you're interested in exploring or bringing together
- What kinds of storytelling or presentation tools/platforms might be a good fit
  * Are you thinking of a linear or chronological approach, how much is text versus other forms of media, is there an interactive visualization (including mapping) component, etc
  * You're also not restricted to the workflows we covered in the lab. If other ideas are sparking (audio, video, 360/immersive, etc), explore them!
- Who would be the audience for what you build; how do you imagine them interacting with your project
- What are you (or your group) well-positioned to develop; What are you less sure of, or what skills will you/your group need to build or acquire
- Other questions you have or comments on ideas, goals, and next steps.

At this point, your responses may be preliminary in draft form. That's fine! We'll have space and time next week (along with targeted class work) to further hone these ideas.

## Step #3: 11/2 University Archives visit

On Thursday 11/2, we'll spend another class period in the University Archives, this time looking at materials and objects that might relate or connect to the game programs we've been working with. 
- [Link to 11/2 slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1dJyOXNoIjNRgo0TlClzbPHgs2_5PoNyw5SQ0vKG_s6A/edit#slide=id.g2261178f27b_0_0)
- [Link to Archives materials list]()

## Step #4: Flesh out proposal, start to map onto possible final project horizons

Continue developing your Step #2 responses. 

- What kinds of sources you're interested in exploring or bringing together
- What kinds of storytelling or presentation tools/platforms might be a good fit
  * Are you thinking of a linear or chronological approach, how much is text versus other forms of media, is there an interactive visualization (including mapping) component, etc
  * You're also not restricted to the workflows we covered in the lab. If other ideas are sparking (audio, video, 360/immersive, etc), explore them!
- Who would be the audience for what you build; how do you imagine them interacting with your project
- What are you (or your group) well-positioned to develop; What are you less sure of, or what skills will you/your group need to build or acquire
- Other questions you have or comments on ideas, goals, and next steps.

Your work here could here could be a longer narrative (at least 500 words) that synthesizes your responses to these prompts. You could also break out your responses into distinct sections for each question (sources, formats, users, open questions/next steps). 
- Visual models like [concept maps or wireframes](https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/what-is-a-wireframe-guide/) aren't required. But I encourage folks to explore that mode of organizing and refining your thinking if it would be helpful.
- We'll start talking in more depth about the final project in a few weeks. If you're thinking about this proposal being part of the final project, folks may be interested in our [final project proposal template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ROYfpEJBA6TqzG9UF7xdkw8GFWjSKCe6jqbp8_Ay9CM/edit#heading=h.m1d7wm3zbe9p).
