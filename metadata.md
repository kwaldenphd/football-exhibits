## What is Metadata?

Metadata is often defined or described as "data that provides information about other data" ([Merriam Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/metadata)).

Within the world of digital information systems, "metadata, the information we create, store, and share to describe things, allows us to interact with these things to obtain the knowledge we need" (Jenn Riley, "[Understanding Metadata: What is Metadata, and What is it For?: A Primer](http://www.niso.org/publications/understanding-metadata-2017)" *National Information Standards Organization*, 2017).

To think about this another way, "In essence, metadata is the extra baggage associated with any resource that enables a real or potential user to find that resource; to decide whether or not it is of value to them; to discover where, when and by whom it was created, as well as for what purpose; to know what tools will be needed to manipulate the resource; to determine whether or not they will actually be allowed access to the resource itself and how much this will cost them. Metadata is, in short, a means by which largely meaningless data may be transformed into information, interpretable and reusable by those other than the creator of the data resource" (Paul Miller, "Metadata: What it Means for Memory Institutions" in *Metadata Applications and Management*, 2004).

From the "[Metadata & Discovery](https://pitt.libguides.com/metadatadiscovery/)" University of Pittsburgh Library Guide authored by Mike Bolam:
<em>
- Metadata aids in managing, publicizing, and preserving the content you have produced. It enhances the usefulness of your data or information by providing context—the who, what, when, where, why, and how that helps to discover, identify, interpret, and interact with content.

- Metadata allows users to:
 * Find or identify a resource
 * Know who created the resource or contributed to the creation of the resource
 * Understand how the resource was created and manipulated
 * Know when the resource was created
 * Determine tools needed to view, manipulate, and use the resource
 * Understand rights and use conditions surrounding the resource
 * Connect to related information objects
</em>

## Metadata in Action

Let's look at a couple examples of metadata in action.

### ND Library Catalog Record

First, open [the ND Library catalog record for Sperber's *Shake Down the Thunder*](https://onesearch.library.nd.edu/permalink/f/1phik6l/ndu_aleph001373767) in a web browser.

Think about what types of information show up in the record for Sperber's book. 
- Information about the book itself
- Information about its location, status, or condition
- Etc.

Since the 1960s, machine readable cataloging (or MARC) records have been the back-bone for library interface and discovery systems.

![physical card from card catalog](https://github.com/kwaldenphd/football-exhibits/blob/main/images/card_catalog.jpg?raw=true)

MARC records developed as a way of taking the information represented in a card catalog and moving it into a digital or computer-aided discovery environment.

![MARC punch chard from University of Kansas Libraries](https://github.com/kwaldenphd/football-exhibits/blob/main/images/marc_punch.png?raw=true)

While MARC records started as physical punch cards, in the last 30 years, MARC records that functioned as databases continue to evolve and transform via the internet.

An example of the [digital MARC record for Sperber's book](https://onesearch.library.nd.edu/primo-explore/sourceRecord?vid=NDU&docId=ndu_aleph001373767), that drive the ND Library catalog record.

### Marble

Another example of metadata in action is [Marble (Museums, Archives, Rare Books, and Libraries Exploration), ND's new digital collections platform](https://marble.nd.edu/) that brings together materials from the Snite Museum of Art, the University's Rare Books and Special Collections, and the University Archive.

From [the ND press release about Marble's launch](https://news.nd.edu/news/notre-dame-launches-platform-for-online-access-to-library-museum-holdings/):
<em>
- University libraries, archives and museums nationwide have been digitizing collections for well over a decade and have long sought collaborative solutions that would enable their respective holdings to be easily discovered online and used for teaching and research. However, there have been many obstacles preventing efficient and expansive research across collections, including disparate technical systems, discipline-specific practices and descriptive metadata norms.

- Faculty, students and the general public can browse Marble and download select digitized materials from the Snite Museum of Art, Rare Books & Special Collections and the University Archives in a single platform — including books, manuscripts, sculptures, paintings, photographs, ephemera and more. Each item displays one or more images with descriptive information and linked metadata to view related or similar items.

- The Marble software...uses a harvest model to draw descriptive information from key source systems and features a shared administrative back-end to augment harvested data. This solution is possible due to a shared understanding of different descriptive terms.

</em>

### University Archives

Now, by way of comparison, let's head to the "[Digital Collections](http://archives.nd.edu/digital/)" page for the University Archives.

Compare your experience navigating this interface and accessing materials to using the University Library catalog or Marble system.

Those vastly different user experiences or ways of engaging/access materials are driven by two key components: technical infrastructure and metadata.

## Metadata Reflection Questions

- Any questions or observations from this section of the lab
- Ideas that spark for how aspects of this work could be useful for telling a story about ND football
  * Or, aspects that might connect to some of the primary source materials we’ve been exploring
