# Immersive or Interactive Digital Stories

The last type of digital exhibit we're going to look at and think about for this lab are immersive or interactive digital stories.

Digital storytelling is a VERY BROAD term that can include everything from podcasts to video essays.

In this lab, we're going to focus on immersive or interactive digital stories that are either driven by metadata and/or operate as a media-rich long-form narrative.

Earlier in this lab, you/your group looked at some of the  [interactive digital stories built using ArcGIS StoryMaps](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-storymaps/albums/digital-humanities).
- NOTE: You could also use open-source tools to generate some of the features/functionality you're seeing in StoryMaps.
  * [An example built using JavaScript](https://bostonopioid.github.io/discarded-needle/index.html)
  * [Juncture platform that stitches together JavaScript and Jekyll and integrates with GitHub Pages](https://juncture-digital.org/)
- ANOTHER NOTE: An alternate platform that is well-suited to media-rich immersive long-form narratives (but does not support interactive mapping) is Adobe Spark
  * [Example](https://spark.adobe.com/page/OVvbwUF0Qo1Cs/)

A few other types of work that might fall under this umbrella...

**Timelines**

- Platform: [TimelineJS](http://timeline.knightlab.com/) (Northwestern's Knight Lab)
- Example: [Notre Dame 1968 Timeline](http://cdn.knightlab.com/libs/timeline3/latest/embed/index.html?source=1MPga-KBhpiRiEK-caa_oPJawa8z129D1EnFzppi6YjU&font=Default&lang=en&initial_zoom=2&height=850&fbclid=IwAR1RDYYtV7cntvxMtXibUxXJjXEulZys-skG0qAL06nm-ksHIWqO0MxkJns)
- Tutorial: https://remix.nd.edu/interactive-timeline.html

**Map**

Platform: [StoryMapJS](http://storymap.knightlab.com/) (Northwestern's Knight Lab)

Examples:
- [Fists of Freedom: Reactions to John Carlos and Tommie Smith's 1968 Protest, Dr. Louis Moore](https://uploads.knightlab.com/storymapjs/3107230e5eafea9f5e74496d4a1a0f40/black-fists/index.html)

Tutorial: https://lindseywieck.org/fall_2016_sf/storymapjstutorial.html

Platform: [CurateScape, built on Omeka](https://curatescape.org)

Examples:
- [Prof. Walden's sandbox site](http://kwaldenphd.com/curatescape-sandbox/)
- [College of Charleston](https://curatescape.org/projects/discovering-our-past-college-of-charleston-histories/)

- [University of Oregon Library Guide](https://researchguides.uoregon.edu/c.php?g=900917&p=6482491)

**Interactive Data Visualization**

Platform (with example): [StorylineJS](http://storyline.knightlab.com/) (Northwestern's Knight Lab)

NOTE: You could also generate annotated interactive visualizations programmatically using Plotly in Python or RStudio.
- [Python](https://plotly.com/python/text-and-annotations/)
- [RStudio](https://plotly.com/ggplot2/text-and-annotations/)

**360 photo/video**

There's also a whole world of 360 photo/video and virtual reality adjacent work that might fall under the digital storytelling umbrella.

A few user-friendly tools that support 360 photo/video:
- [SceneVR](https://scene.knightlab.com/) (Northwestern's Knight Lab)
- [Story Spheres](https://storyspheres.com/)
- [Google Cardboard Camera app](https://blog.google/products/google-ar-vr/cardboard-camera-ios/)

There's also a whole other world of more advanced tech applications in the area of [VR/MR/AR/XR](https://medium.com/@effinmickey/vr-ar-mr-xr-and-360-everything-youve-always-wanted-to-know-ae33e4515493) and [photogrammetry](https://rd.nytimes.com/projects/an-end-to-end-guide-to-photogrammetry-with-mobile-devices).

## Immersive/Interactive Digital Stories Reflection Questions

- Any questions or observations from this section of the lab
- Ideas that spark for how aspects of this work could be useful for telling a story about ND football
  * Or, aspects that might connect to some of the primary source materials weâ€™ve been exploring
