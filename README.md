# Overview

This lab will involve working with digital archive and exhibit platforms and tools to think about avenues for presenting or sharing historical work. Specifically, it focuses on workflows for building out item-level metadata needed to generate a robust digital archive/exhibit and prototyping options for sharing or presenting that work using digital exhibits and interactive digital storytelling tools. 

This lab provides a few different types of open-ended opportunities for thinking about how to share/communicate/present information related to primary source materials, in a smaller-scale, lower-stakes setting than the final project. I encourage folks to approach this lab as a pilot or “proof of concept” for work they might want to continue or develop further in the final project.

# How to Work Through This Lab

[Link to Google Drive workspace for this lab](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13uxuOwLOO6taBSmj-8OvDnWf7EcKQZu3?usp=sharing)

This lab is organized into three main sections:
- What's possible under the umbrella of digital archives, digital exhibits, and immersive/interactive digital storytelling
- What's involved in building these kinds of projects or components
- What might be possible with these tools/approaches and primary sources or archival material related to ND football

So the lab starts by looking at existing digital projects that incorporate these tools/methods, to think about what might be possible related to the work of this class.

Then, folks will have a chance to work behind-the-scenes with building these types of projects.

In that behind the scenes work, we'll be thinking about...
- The technical infrastructure needed to publish these projects
- The metadata that drives these projects
- What types of contextual or narrative information is also part of these projects

Lastly, folks will have a chance to take up these methods to source material of your choosing that relates to ND football.

As we think about how you could take up or extend these methods, we'll be doing that with an eye toward the final project.

## Lab Notebook Components

- Reflections/observations from the Background section of the lab
- Reflections/observations from the Metadata section of the lab
- Reflections/observations from your work exploring tools and sample projects
- Your group's work building out digital exhibit/archive and immersive/interactive digital story
  * Any data files you worked with
  * Public-facing things you created (GitHub Pages site, Omeka collection/exhibit, StoryMap, timeline, etc)
- Individual reflection
  * At least 200 words (or 2-3 minutes audio/video), addressing the following questions:
    * What you learned about metadata through this lab
    * What you learned about digital exhibits/archives through this lab
    * What you learned about immersive/interactive digital storytelling through this lab
    * How you're thinking about these tools/approaches as they relate to ND football history and primary sources differently after this lab
    * Where you would go next with these tools/methods (other research questions/topics you're interested in exploring, other data sources or types of data you would want to be able to work with, etc)
    * Other comments/questions/observations

If you're working in Google Drive, you can just submit a link to Google Drive.

Notebooks can be individual or collaborative.

# Background

Explore...
- [One of the Colored Conventions Projects exhibits](https://coloredconventions.org/exhibits/) (many to choose from!)
- [One of the place-based walking tour projects](https://curatescape.org/projects/)
- [One of the interactive digital stories built using ArcGIS StoryMaps](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-storymaps/albums/digital-humanities)

As you explore, consider…
- What types of sources it uses, and how it uses those sources (interactive maps/visualizations, text, immersive media, etc)
- Choices the authors/creators made around design and presentation, and how that shapes the user experience 
  * To put that another way, what are some of your takeaways from engaging with the project? What aspects of the project stand out to you (and how/why)?
- Ideas that spark for how aspects of what this project is doing could be useful for telling a story about ND football
  * Or, aspects of the project design/composition that might connect to some of the primary source materials we’ve been exploring 

# Metadata

# Sample Digital Exhibit/Archive Projects

Now, we're going to think about how we can use metadata to build digital archives/exhibits, thinking about...
- technical infrastructure
- metadata
- other information

[Link to this section of the lab](https://github.com/kwaldenphd/football-exhibits/blob/main/sample-projects.md)

# Immersive or Interactive Digital Stories

The last type of digital exhibit we're going to look at and think about for this lab are immersive or interactive digital stories.

Digital storytelling is a VERY BROAD term that can include everything from podcasts to video essays.

In this lab, we're going to focus on immersive or interactive digital stories that are either driven by metadata and/or operate as a media-rich long-form narrative.

# Next Steps

Now it's your turn to work in your group to begin exploring what might be possible with these tools/approaches and primary sources (or archival material) related to ND football.

[Link to this section of the lab](https://github.com/kwaldenphd/football-exhibits/blob/main/next-steps.md)

Each group is asked to build out three different types of digital exhibits as part of this lab.

**#1: Spin up a working instance of Wax or CollectionBuilder OR substantively modify/expand Prof. Walden's sandbox sites.**

For #1, some of the things that you'll need to build out along the way will include...
- Site text
- Metadata
- Pages/configuration

**#2: Develop a Omeka Collection based on ND Archive materials**

For #2, some of the things that you'll need to build out along the way will include...
- Metadata
  * Potentially also exhibit curation/configuration

**#3: Build a small-scale immersive/interactive digital story**

Options include:
- Adobe Spark
- ArcGIS StoryMaps
- Timeline JS
- Storymap JS
- Storyline JS
- Curatescape (built on Omeka)
- Something open-source/homegrown
- If you want to dabble in 360/VR/AR/MR
  * StorySphere
  * SceneVR
  * Etc

For #3, some of the things that you'll need to build out along the way might include...
- Object inventory
- Design/visual content
- Text
- Interactive map(s)
- Metadata

## Collaborating Well

Collaboration is also your friend here- you don't have to come up with all the ideas or do all the work on your own. For example, CDT/CSE folks can focus on building out the technical infrastructure for the static sites. Data Science folks (or folks comfortable working with structured data) can focus on building on the metadata. Folks who want to think about front-end presentation or user experience could focus on task #3 and provide input on things like exhibit text, page layout, item tags, etc. for #1 and #2.

In short, leverage the group's strengths. And divide/conquer.

Folks are welcome to meet with me (individually or as a group) to ask questions and think about next steps for how to approach this lab.

## Where to Start and Next Steps

The big picture workflow or steps in this process:
- Selecting materials
- Building out metadata
- Configuring static sites
- Building a digital story
