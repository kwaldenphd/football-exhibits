# Next Steps

Now it's your turn to work in your group to begin exploring what might be possible with these tools/approaches and primary sources (or archival material) related to ND football.

Each group is asked to build out three different types of digital exhibits as part of this lab.

**#1: Spin up a working instance of Wax or CollectionBuilder OR substantively modify/expand Prof. Walden's sandbox sites.**

For #1, some of the things that you'll need to build out along the way will include...
- Site text
- Metadata
- Pages/configuration

**#2: Develop a Omeka Collection based on ND Archive materials**

For #2, some of the things that you'll need to build out along the way will include...
- Metadata
  * Potentially also exhibit curation/configuration

**#3: Build a small-scale immersive/interactive digital story**

Options include:
- Adobe Spark
- ArcGIS StoryMaps
- Timeline JS
- Storymap JS
- Storyline JS
- Curatescape (built on Omeka)
- Something open-source/homegrown
- If you want to dabble in 360/VR/AR/MR
  * StorySphere
  * SceneVR
  * Etc

For #3, some of the things that you'll need to build out along the way might include...
- Object inventory
- Design/visual content
- Text
- Interactive map(s)
- Metadata

## Collaborating Well

Collaboration is also your friend here- you don't have to come up with all the ideas or do all the work on your own. For example, CDT/CSE folks can focus on building out the technical infrastructure for the static sites. Data Science folks (or folks comfortable working with structured data) can focus on building on the metadata. Folks who want to think about front-end presentation or user experience could focus on task #3 and provide input on things like exhibit text, page layout, item tags, etc. for #1 and #2.

In short, leverage the group's strengths. And divide/conquer.

Folks are welcome to meet with me (individually or as a group) to ask questions and think about next steps for how to approach this lab.

## Where to Start: Selecting Materials

The first step is figuring out what materials you want to work with for task #2.

Each collection has Google Drive links for the bulk downloaded files and starter metadata.
- [Link to list of collections with Google Drive links](https://github.com/kwaldenphd/football-exhibits/blob/main/archive-resources.md)

NOTE: If you are planning on working using the Scholastic student magazine or Observer student newspaper to create a static site in Wax, you will need to select a subset of years to avoid hitting GitHub repository limits (and avoid crashing the Rake tasks)
- CollectionBuilder can pull from URLs so you won't have the same issue

## Next Steps: Metadata

Once you've selected materials to work with, you'll need to build out metadata for the static site platform and Omeka.

Prof. Walden has created metadata templates for each platform, and pulled starter metadata (URLs, file names, object descriptions) from the ND Archives.

Google Drive:
- [Metadata templates](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NuVx0qiOBahf0neMnT9RYF_VlwkgiiVv?usp=sharing)
- [Folder with starter metadata](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Cl4d22PQgJd6wKsjNq3W2mxGA01QZK3F?usp=sharing)

Copy what you need into your group's Google Drive folder (or create shortcuts) and build out two metadata files:
- Static site (Wax or Collection Builder)
- Omeka

## Next Steps: Static Sites

Note on scope: You're not being asked to develop a full-scale functioning project here. Folks working on this task should expect to spend 1-2 hours working on the static site you're buliding.

### Next Steps: Omeka

Note on scope: You're not being asked to develop a full-scale exhibit here. Folks working on this task should expect to spend 1-2 hours working on building metadata for a collection of materials.

Step 1: [Copy Omeka metadata template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1dMWU5a2xe6S4vVjNUrsXXVETJkdj8gH0xfEi6Cuk5VU/edit?usp=sharing)

Step 2: If needed, take a look at [sample Omeka metadata](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dU2jGfitJkLn6XOmCRglXIYu0QnnZs4P?usp=sharing)

Step 3: [Add the existing metadata for your collection](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Cl4d22PQgJd6wKsjNq3W2mxGA01QZK3F?usp=sharing) to your copy of the Omeka template
- Directories (Christian, Juan)
- Magazine (KMCPLC)
- Observer (Audrey, Sydney, Kelly, Chris, Amy)
- Scholastic (Jack Coan)
- Voice (Charlotte, Grace, Maura, Carolyn, Caitlyn)

Step 4: Fill out the rest of the metadata template ([more documentation on metadata fields](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Content/Working_with_Dublin_Core/))

Step 5: Send metadata file to Prof. Walden
- Or, if you want to create the collection in Omeka yourself...
  * Log in to Omeka Sandbox site using your ND email ([public site](http://kwaldenphd.com/omeka-classic-sandbox/), [admin login](http://kwaldenphd.com/omeka-classic-sandbox/admin/))
  * [Create a collection](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Content/Collections/)
  * [Import using `CSV Import` plugin](https://omeka.org/classic/docs/Plugins/CSV_Import/)

Step 6: Head to http://kwaldenphd.com/omeka-classic-sandbox/ to check out your collection!

## While You're Working on All of That...Task #3

The last thing you're asked to do is build a small-scale immersive/interactive digital story.
- Note on scope: You're not being asked to develop a full-scale research project here. Folks working on this task should expect to spend 1-2 hours working on whatever you're building.
- Folks can work collaboratively on the same project or work individually with different tools. 

Step 1: The first step is figuring out what platform(s) or tool(s) you want to explore and what you're interested in building.

Options include:
- Adobe Spark
- ArcGIS StoryMaps
- Timeline JS
- Storymap JS
- Storyline JS
- CurateScape (built on Omeka- Prof. Walden has a sandbox site already created. Let her know if you want to be added)
- Something open-source/homegrown
- If you want to dabble in 360/VR/AR/MR
  * StorySphere
  * SceneVR
  * Etc

Step 2: Once you've nailed that down, you might need to build out things like...
- Object inventory
- Design/visual content
- Text
- Interactive map(s)
- Metadata
