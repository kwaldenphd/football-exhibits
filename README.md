This lab involves thinking about how to move from item-level metadata to different modes of curating, connecting, and contextualizing primary source material using digital tools and platforms. 

We'll start by thinking about how we add to item-level metadata to more fully contextualize a particular primary source, with an eye toward being able to make connections with other sources (or types of source material).

Then we'll think about different tools or methods that let us connect this contextual information to primary sources, and connect primary sources with each other, in the service of a larger historical narrative or argument.

In addition to the different platforms we'll explore in this lab, our work will be the foundation for a [public digital exhibit through the Hesburgh Libraries](https://digital-exhibits.library.nd.edu/). 

## Exploring other projects 

# Background

Explore...
- [One of the Colored Conventions Projects exhibits](https://coloredconventions.org/exhibits/) (many to choose from!)
- [One of the place-based walking tour projects](https://curatescape.org/projects/)
- [One of the interactive digital stories built using ArcGIS StoryMaps](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-storymaps/albums/digital-humanities)

As you explore, consider…
- What types of sources it uses, and how it uses those sources (interactive maps/visualizations, text, immersive media, etc)
- Choices the authors/creators made around design and presentation, and how that shapes the user experience 
  * To put that another way, what are some of your takeaways from engaging with the project? What aspects of the project stand out to you (and how/why)?
- Ideas that spark for how aspects of what this project is doing could be useful for telling a story about ND football
  * Or, aspects of the project design/composition that might connect to some of the primary source materials we’ve been exploring 

## Background

We'll be anchoring our work in this lab around a set of primary sources- specifically the Notre Dame Football game programs whose reproductions hang in the renovated stadium concourse. 

<p align="center"><img src="https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/edf2e00/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4916x3461+0+0/resize/880x620!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Flegacy%2Fsites%2Fwvpe%2Ffiles%2F201708%2Fconcourse.jpg"></p>

The 2017 renovation project that led to the selection of these game programs for the concourse was part of the multi-million dollar "Campus Crossroads" project.

We'll have a chance to see these game program reproductions in-person in a few weeks when we visit the stadium.

## Metadata

This collection of game programs (70 total) span 1913 to 1969.
- [Link to game program metadata](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fxH_fkXg5P2CFWSkoJ-pCM5n20mwuObXwErK9ZUtGUo/edit#gid=298564474)
- [Link to stadium concourse diagram](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11aCaWfr1dNcPQkMadq9hvdqYlcyZNRDH/view?usp=drive_link)

The metadata Google Sheets workbook has a few different tabs:
- `concourse-programs` includes information on where the programs are located in the stadium concourse, as well as basic game metadata (date, opponent, location, score)
- `game-annotations` is where we'll start to flesh out details and other context information for each program
- `season-annotations` is where we'll start to flesh out details and other context information for each season
- `era-annotations` is where (if needed) we'll start to flesh out details and other context information for the eras represented by the stadium concourse programs
- `other-sources` is where folks can include linsk to non-University Archives material

We have a corresponding Google Drive infrastructure, in the `[concourse-programs](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-pKjILRWe-HP8FdVvsiUHpq-dFPZDt0G?usp=drive_link)` folder which groups programs by season, and includes placeholder folders for other sources we may find and want to connect to the game programs.

# Part I: Developing Annotations 

Before we start thinking about how we connect different sources (or bodies of source material), we need additional background and context on the game programs.

**Step #1: Identify 3-4 game programs you want to write annotations for. Add your name to the `Assignment` tab in the [`season-annotations` sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fxH_fkXg5P2CFWSkoJ-pCM5n20mwuObXwErK9ZUtGUo/edit#gid=298564474).**

Once folks have claimed game programs, we'll form 4 groups loosely organized by date (and head coach era):
- Group #1: 1913-1930 (Jesse Harper, Knute Rockne)
- Group #2: 1931-1943 (Frank Leahy, part i)
- Group #3: 1944-1953 (Frank Leahy, part ii)
- Group #4: 1954-1971 (Ara Parseghian)

Folks can work primarily individually on the individual game program annotations, but leverage the group to write brief overview or recaps of each season and era.
- Add group member names to the `Assignment` columns in the `season-annotations` and `era-annotations` sheets once you're in a group.
- Feel free to divide and conquer individual seasons within the group.

**Step #2: Start preliminary research, using key University Archives collections as a starting point:**

Dig into the game program itself

Then fold in other University Archives sources
- [Digest of University Archives digital collections](https://github.com/kwaldenphd/football-exhibits/blob/main/archive-resources.md) 
  * [Scholastic student magazine, 1867-2011](https://archives.nd.edu/Scholastic/)
  * [Scholastic football season reviews, 1901-2010](https://archives.nd.edu/Football/)
  * [Observer student newspaper, 1966-present](https://archives.nd.edu/Observer/)

Folks could do much deeper dives on particular games, seasons, or eras. For now, try to ground your annotations in at least one primary source (beyond the game program itself).
- Add a PDF or image file of the source(s) you're using to the relevant subfolder in the [`concourse-programs` Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-pKjILRWe-HP8FdVvsiUHpq-dFPZDt0G).
- Don't be afraid to use screenshots or images from larger documents if there's something specific you want to highlight.

Other encyclopedic resources (Wikipedia, College Football Reference, etc) are fair game- just make sure you cite appropriately (and note other sources you're using in the `other-sources` [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fxH_fkXg5P2CFWSkoJ-pCM5n20mwuObXwErK9ZUtGUo/edit#gid=1385143351) tab).

**Step #3: Write the game annotations.**

In the context of football game programs, your annotation can cover....
- When and where the game took place.
- Result of the game (and mention of any events of note around the game)
- Brief description of what's on the program cover

An [example annotation that includes some of these components](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/digital/footballcovers/items/footballcovers90.html), courtesy of the University of Idaho Libraries.
- If you want to explore further, head to the [Hesburgh Libraries' Digital Exhibits website](https://digital-exhibits.library.nd.edu/) for various examples of annotations that in many cases go beyond the scope of what you're asked to develop for this lab.

Annotations can go in the `Annotation` column for each sheet. If you're struggling to make your annotation work in the spreadsheet format, we'll figure out another workflow.

**Step #4: Write the season or era annotations.**

Once group members have developed annotations for their individual game programs, work as a group to write a brief season overview. 

In the context of this lab, a season annotation can be a few sentences/paragraph that mentions...
- Head coach, stand-out players (or other members of the coaching staff)
- The season result (win-loss record, and any bowl games or playoff appearances)
- Notable games (or other events of note)

An era annotation can cover similar ground- a few sentences/paragraph that mentions...
- How the head coach arrived at Notre Dame (prior work / background)
- The coach's record (wins/losses, other notable achievements)
- Notable seasons or events
- Coach's legacy (statue, building, etc)

**Step #5: Some kind of reflection/debrief something**

What were you able to communicate, what isn't showing up

Where you'd want to go next

Other comments/constraints on form (or how we're understanding/engaging with this info differently)

## Part II: Digital Exhibit/Storytelling Shallow Dives

Now that we have a solid foundation of metadata and annotations for the game programs, let's jump 
into a couple different digital workflows that let us connect and organize our work.

### Timeline

TIMELINE JS WORK GOES HERE (lots of copying/pasting, working with the template)

### Map

ARCGIS STORY MAP WORK GOES HERE

Link to our group: https://arcg.is/1C1Xry2

How much are they just annotating map points (versus digging into other aspects of StoryMaps functionality)

### Exhibit

Curatescape: http://kwaldenphd.com/curatescape-sandbox/

What I'd need to do on the front for prep so they could just jump into their items and add info

Central login?

## Part III: Digital Exhibit/Storytelling Wireframe

Now that we've seen a few different examples  to think about how we might connect or organize them (and eventually other sources) in some kind of digital space.

**Step #1: a shit ton of reflection/ideation**

Individual reflection, small group debrief

- What were you able to accomplish
- What you like about what you did
- Ways in which the platform/medium choices shape historical narrative/argument (meaning making); ways we understand the history shaped by how it's presented

- Where would you want to go next
- Other types of sources, additional research
- Other modes of presentation

We've seen examples of other kinds of digital storytelling or treatment of sources....
- [ND Stories, How ND became the Fighting Irish](https://www.nd.edu/stories/whats-in-a-name/) (media-rich narrative)
- [Audio version](https://news.nd.edu/news/how-notre-dame-became-the-fighting-irish/)

All the other things they could explore/build
- Adobe Spark/Express
- ArcGIS StoryMaps
- Timeline JS
- Storymap JS
- Storyline JS
- Curatescape (built on Omeka)
- Something open-source/homegrown
- If you want to dabble in 360/VR/AR/MR
  * StorySphere
  * SceneVR
  * Etc

For these options, some of the things that you might need to build out along the way could include...
- Object inventory
- Design/visual content
- Text
- Interactive map(s)
- Metadata

**Step #2: Start to flesh out a proposal / project plane / exhibit wireframe**

What kinds of sources, what kinds of storytelling methods/tools/platforms

Audience, desired user experience 

What do you have, what remains to be done

**Step #3: 11/2 University Archives visit**


**Step #4: Flesh out proposal, start to map onto possible final project horizons**
